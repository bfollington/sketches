A collection of generative art sketches using [`clojure`](https://clojure.org/), [`quil`](http://www.quil.info/) and [`figwheel-main`](https://figwheel.org/).

Based off the [`figwheel-main-template`](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main-template) for `leiningen`.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig -b dev -r

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min
